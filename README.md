# Reinforcement-Learning-Race-Track-Controller
An AI agent capable of navigating a simulated racetrack environment using Reinforcement Learning. The project implements Value Iteration, Q-Learning, and SARSA algorithms to solve the Markov Decision Process (MDP) of the racetrack, featuring collision detection with Bresenham's algorithm and multiple crash recovery policies.
